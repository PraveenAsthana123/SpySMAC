    "description_of_scatter_plots": "These scatter plots give you for every instance, represented by a dot, a direct comparison of the corresponding runtime for the configurations. We can see the runtime for the default configuration on the logarithmic x-axis and the optimized configuration on the logarithmic y-axis. The diagonal splits the graph in an upper triangle, in which the default configuration outperformed the optimized configuration and a lower triangle, in which the optimized configuration outperformed the default configuration."

  "description_of_cumulative_distribution_function" : "The runtime distribution plots visualize the percentage of solved instances within a given runtime. Therefore we can see the runtime in logarithmic form on the x-axis and the percentage of solved instances, from the underlying distribution, on the y-axis. The functions stop at the given cutoff time and the higher the probability the better."

  "description_of_fanova" : "This chapter shows the result of functional Analysis Of VAriance (fANOVA) for the SMAC runs also mentioned in \\cite{fANOVA}. It estimates the performance importance of each parameter by its responsible variance of performance in percentage (see table \\ref{tab:parameter_importance}). It also gives you for each setting of a parameter a performance estimation marginalized over the possible settings of the other parameters and visualized in the following plots."
